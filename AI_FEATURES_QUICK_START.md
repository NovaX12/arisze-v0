## 🔥 Top Priorities (Start Here)

### **This Week (Week 1):**

1. **Set up Google Cloud Project**
   - Enable Vertex AI API
   - Get API credentials
   - Test Gemini 1.5 Flash model

2. **Install Socket.io**
   ```bash
   pnpm add socket.io socket.io-client
   ```

3. **Create MongoDB Collections**
   ```javascript
   // chatMessages
   {
     senderId: ObjectId,
     receiverId: ObjectId,
     message: String,
     timestamp: Date,
     moderationFlag: Boolean
   }

   // quizGames
   {
     player1Id: ObjectId,
     player2Id: ObjectId,
     questions: [QuizQuestion],
     scores: { player1: Number, player2: Number },
     winner: ObjectId,
     timestamp: Date
   }

   // quizQuestions
   {
     question: String,
     options: [String],
     correct: String,
     category: String,
     difficulty: String,
     timesPlayed: Number,
     correctnessRate: Number
   }
   ```

4. **Create `/ai-hub` Page**
   - Copy structure from `/dashboard/page.tsx`
   - Add placeholder sections for Chat and Quiz

5. **Add Navigation Link**
   - Update main navigation bar
   - Add "AI Hub" link with icon

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan

### **Beta Testing (Weeks 9-10):**
- Invite 20 students (10 from VU, 10 from KTU)
- Each tester must:
  - Start at least 1 chat
  - Play at least 1 quiz game
  - Complete feedback survey

### **Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Zero critical bugs
- ✅ 80%+ positive feedback
- ✅ Chat latency <500ms
- ✅ Quiz generation <3 seconds

## ⚠️ Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| AI generates wrong answers | Golden set validation, user "Report" button |
| Low adoption | Dashboard widget, notifications, badges |
| Quiz matchmaking fails | "Play vs. AI" single-player mode |
| Vertex AI costs exceed budget | Set $50/day spending cap |
| Chat abuse/spam | AI moderation, rate limiting (10 msg/min) |
