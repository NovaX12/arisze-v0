## MongoDB Atlas Connection Issues

### **Issue Description**
MongoDB Atlas connection and authentication configuration issues that were preventing proper database connectivity and user authentication.

**Previous Error Symptoms:**
```
querySrv ENOTFOUND _mongodb._tcp.cluster0.mongodb.net
MongoDB URI mismatch between .env.local and hardcoded values
Google OAuth conflicts with credentials authentication
Missing NextAuth environment variables
```

**Current Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Root Cause:**
- MongoDB URI mismatch between `.env.local` and hardcoded values in `lib/mongodb.ts`
- `USE_MOCK_DB=true` was overriding real database connections
- Google OAuth provider conflicts with credentials-based authentication
- Missing `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variables
- Mock database fallback was preventing real database connection testing

**Solution Implemented:**
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Completely removed mock database implementation from `lib/mongodb.ts`
- Updated MongoDB URI to correct cluster: `arisze.y20yxd7.mongodb.net` (was using wrong cluster)
- Removed Google OAuth provider to eliminate authentication conflicts
- Added proper NextAuth environment variables and debugging logs
- Implemented proper error handling that throws errors instead of falling back to mock

**Impact:**
- ✅ **Full Database Connectivity**: Application connects to MongoDB Atlas successfully
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Credentials-based login/registration works properly
- ✅ **Real Data Display**: Events and user data from MongoDB Atlas are displayed
- ✅ **Event Creation & Booking**: Users can create events and book them successfully
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Database connection is stable and secure
- ✅ **No Mock Fallback**: Application now uses real database exclusively

**Key Learning - Mock Database Removal:**
The most critical step was **completely removing the mock database implementation**. The mock database was:
1. **Masking real connection issues** - preventing proper debugging of MongoDB Atlas connection
2. **Creating confusion** - making it unclear whether real or mock data was being used
3. **Preventing proper testing** - authentication worked with mock but failed with real database
4. **Causing production issues** - mock data would not exist in production environment

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/mongodb.ts` - **MAJOR CHANGE**: Removed entire mock database class and fallback logic
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - Added comprehensive debugging logs
- `.env.local` - Updated MongoDB URI to correct cluster
- Authentication flow now works exclusively with real MongoDB Atlas database

**Next Steps to Resolve:**
1. **Try Node.js Update**: Update to latest Node.js LTS version
2. **Test with MongoDB Compass**: Verify connection string works in MongoDB Compass
3. **Docker Environment**: Test in Docker with Linux environment
4. **Alternative Driver**: Consider using `mongoose` instead of native `mongodb` driver
5. **Network Configuration**: Check Windows firewall and network settings

**Temporary Solution Status:**
- Mock database provides full MongoDB-compatible API
- All CRUD operations work identically to real database
- Easy to switch to real database by changing `USE_MOCK_DB=false`
- No code changes needed when switching between mock and real database

**Monitoring:**
- Check server logs for "Using mock database for development" message
- Verify `USE_MOCK_DB` environment variable is set correctly
- Test database operations to ensure mock system is working

## Environment Variable Management

### **Issue Description**
The `.env.local` file keeps getting deleted or lost, causing the application to fail to start properly.

**Error Symptoms:**
- Server fails to start with MongoDB connection errors
- NextAuth configuration errors
- Missing environment variables warnings

**Current Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- Environment variables are properly configured in `.env.local`
- Created `.env.example` template file for backup and reference
- File management strategy implemented using terminal commands

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check if `.env.local` exists: `ls -la .env.local` or `dir .env.local`
2. If missing, recreate using terminal commands:
   ```bash
   echo "MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://kathanchauhan22_db_user:NovaX135@arisze.y20yxd7.mongodb.net/arisze?retryWrites=true&w=majority" > .env.local
   echo "NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000" >> .env.local
   echo "NEXTAUTH_SECRET=e7MDq/OBsri6Ldwq9jEGDsKlcAMTQTvZe3ZUIXsm5HA=" >> .env.local
   ```

**Prevention:**
- Consider using a different approach for environment management
- Document the exact environment variables needed
