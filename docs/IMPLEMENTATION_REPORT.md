**Implementation Date**: ${new Date().toISOString()}  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

---

## üéØ Features Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Event Globalization (Show All Public Events)
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Problem**: Events were only showing to the creator, not to all users globally.

**Solution**: Added `isPublic` filtering to the events API endpoint.

**Changes Made**:
- **File**: `app/api/events/route.ts`
- **Lines Modified**: 10-28
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  if (userId) {
    // If requesting specific user's events, show all their events (public and private)
    query.createdBy = userId
  } else {
    // If no userId specified, only show public events globally
    query.isPublic = true
  }
  ```

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ All users can now see public events created by anyone
- ‚úÖ Private events only visible to the creator
- ‚úÖ Event creator's profile page shows all their events (public + private)
- ‚úÖ Main events page shows all public events globally

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Dashboard Profile Editing
**Status**: ALREADY WORKING (Verified)

**Finding**: Profile editing functionality was already fully implemented and working!

**Existing Implementation**:
- **Frontend**: `components/sections/profile-section.tsx` (lines 112-167)
  - Edit form with fields: name, email, year, major, bio
  - Auto-saves to backend on "Save Changes" button
  - Updates session to reflect name changes in navbar
  - Toast notifications for success/failure
  
- **Backend API**: `app/api/users/profile/route.ts`
  - PUT method for updating profile
  - Validates authentication via NextAuth session
  - Updates MongoDB users collection
  - Returns updated user data

**How to Use**:
1. Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Profile Section
2. Click the Edit button (pencil icon)
3. Modify name, year, major, or bio
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Data persists across page reloads and sessions

**No Changes Required**: System is fully functional as-is.

### 3. ‚úÖ Booking System & Participant Management
**Status**: ALREADY WORKING (Verified)

**Finding**: Participant tracking was already fully implemented!

**Existing Implementation**:
- **Booking Creation**: `app/api/events/[id]/book/route.ts`
  - POST endpoint creates booking with `userName` from session
  - Booking includes: userId, userName, userEmail, userPhone, hasGuest, guestInfo
  - Automatically increments event attendee count
  
- **Participant Display**: `app/api/user/created-events/route.ts`
  - GET endpoint fetches events created by user
  - Joins bookings collection to get participant details
  - Returns participant list with names, emails, guest info
  
- **Frontend Display**: `components/sections/my-events-section.tsx`
  - "View Participants" button on created events
  - Shows participant modal with full details
  - Real-time participant count display
  - Guest information included

**How It Works**:
1. User A creates event ‚Üí stored in `events` collection with `createdBy: userId`
2. User B books event ‚Üí booking created in `bookings` collection with User B's name
3. User A clicks "View Participants" ‚Üí API fetches bookings for that event
4. Participant list shows: User B's name, email, phone, guest details

**No Changes Required**: System is fully functional as-is.

### 4. ‚úÖ Event Cancellation Feature
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Problem**: No way for event creators to cancel/delete their events.

**Solution**: Created DELETE endpoint and added UI button with confirmation.

**Changes Made**:

#### A. Backend API (NEW FILE)
- **File**: `app/api/events/[id]/route.ts` (CREATED)
- **Methods**: 
  - DELETE: Cancel event (creator only)
  - GET: Fetch single event details

**DELETE Endpoint Logic**:
```typescript
1. Verify user authentication (NextAuth session)
2. Validate event ID format (ObjectId)
3. Find event and verify ownership (createdBy === userId)
4. Count affected bookings
5. Delete all bookings for this event
6. Delete all eventParticipants records
7. Delete userCreatedEvents tracking record
8. Update user's event profile stats (decrement eventsCreated)
9. Delete the event itself
10. Return success with deletedBookings count
```

**Authorization**:
- ‚úÖ Only event creator can delete their events
- ‚úÖ Returns 403 Forbidden if user is not the creator
- ‚úÖ Returns 404 if event doesn't exist

#### B. Frontend UI (UPDATED)
- **File**: `components/sections/my-events-section.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  1. Added `cancelEvent` function (lines 150-175)
  2. Added "Cancel Event" button in Created Events tab (lines 390-397)

**UI Features**:
- ‚úÖ Red "Cancel Event" button next to "View Participants"
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog shows participant count
- ‚úÖ Success toast shows number of deleted bookings
- ‚úÖ Event removed from UI immediately after deletion
- ‚úÖ Error handling with user-friendly messages

**User Experience**:
1. Go to Dashboard ‚Üí My Events ‚Üí Created tab
2. Find your event and click "Cancel Event" button
3. Confirm deletion in dialog (shows participant count)
4. Event is deleted along with all bookings
5. Toast notification shows success + booking count

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Booking Cancellation
**Status**: ALREADY WORKING (Verified)

**Finding**: Booking cancellation was already fully implemented!

**Existing Implementation**:
- **Backend**: `app/api/events/[id]/book/route.ts`
  - DELETE method cancels individual booking
  - Decrements event attendee count
  - Removes booking from database
  
- **Frontend**: `components/sections/my-events-section.tsx`
  - "Cancel" button on each booked event
  - Toast notifications for success/failure
  - Real-time UI update

**How to Use**:
