## 📋 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Test the Debug Panel
1. Make sure dev server is running: `pnpm dev`
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/events
3. Look for **purple/pink bug button** in bottom-right corner
4. Click it to open debug panel

### Step 2: Check All Systems
The debug panel will show 3 status indicators:
- 🔍 **Database** - Should be "connected" (green ✅)
- 👤 **Session** - Should be "authenticated" (green ✅) if logged in
- 🌐 **API** - Should be "healthy" (green ✅)

### Step 3: Test Event Creation
Click the **"🧪 Test Event Creation API"** button in debug panel

**What this does:**
- Sends real POST request to /api/events
- Shows complete request/response
- Logs everything in activity panel
- Tests if API works independently of form

### Step 4: Try Creating Event from Form
1. Fill out the event creation form
2. Press F12 to open browser console
3. Click "Create Event" button
4. Watch BOTH:
   - Browser console (left side)
   - Debug panel activity log (right side)

### Step 5: Report Back
Tell me:
1. What are the 3 status indicators showing? (Database/Session/API)
2. What happens when you click "Test Event Creation API"?
3. What do you see in browser console when you try to create event?
4. Copy the logs from debug panel (click "Copy Logs" button)

## 🔍 What to Look For

### If Database Status is RED ❌
```
Problem: Can't connect to MongoDB
Solution: Check .env.local file, MongoDB Atlas connection
```

### If Session Status is RED ❌
```
Problem: Not logged in
Solution: Go to /login and log in
```

### If API Status is RED ❌
```
Problem: Dev server not responding
Solution: Restart dev server (pnpm dev)
```

### If Test Button Shows Error
```
Problem: API endpoint broken
Solution: Check server terminal for error logs
```

### If Form Shows "Failed to fetch"
```
Problem: Either network or API issue
Solution: Check browser console logs, look for the exact error
```

## 🐛 Common Issues We Can Now Diagnose

### Issue 1: Field Mismatch
**Log to look for:**
```
❌ [SERVER] Missing fields: venue
OR
❌ [SERVER] Venue/cafe name is required
```

**What it means:** Form sending wrong field name  
**Fix:** Check if form sends both `cafe` and `venue`

### Issue 2: Authentication Failed
**Log to look for:**
```
❌ [EVENT CREATION] No session found
OR
❌ [SERVER] Unauthorized: No session found
```

**What it means:** Not logged in or session expired  
**Fix:** Log in again

### Issue 3: Database Connection
**Log to look for:**
```
❌ [TEST-CONNECTION] Database connection failed
OR
❌ Failed to connect to MongoDB Atlas
```

**What it means:** Can't reach database  
**Fix:** Check MongoDB Atlas, .env.local

### Issue 4: Validation Error
**Log to look for:**
```
❌ [EVENT CREATION] Validation failed - missing fields
OR
❌ [SERVER] Missing required fields: ...
```

**What it means:** Required field empty or wrong format  
**Fix:** Fill all required fields, check data types

### Issue 5: JSON Parse Error
**Log to look for:**
```
❌ [EVENT CREATION] Failed to parse response JSON
📄 [EVENT CREATION] Response was: <html>...
```

**What it means:** Server returned error page not JSON  
**Fix:** Check server logs for crash/error
