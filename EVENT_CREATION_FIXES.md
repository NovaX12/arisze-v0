# Event Creation & Booking - Fixed Issues

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Field Name Mismatch** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Frontend was sending `cafe` field but backend expected `venue` field
**Solution:** 
- Updated API to accept BOTH `cafe` and `venue` for backward compatibility
- Added `university` field to Event model (was missing)

### 2. **Missing Required Fields** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Event model didn't include `university` field
**Solution:**
- Added `university: string` to Event interface in `lib/models.ts`
- Updated API validation to require university field

### 3. **Poor Error Handling** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Generic error messages didn't help debug issues
**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the event creation flow
- Added detailed validation error messages
- Added step-by-step console logs for debugging

### 4. **Data Type Validation** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** maxAttendees wasn't properly validated
**Solution:**
- Added proper parseInt() and NaN checking
- Added range validation (1-100)
- Better error messages for validation failures

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. `lib/models.ts`
```typescript
export interface Event {
  _id?: string
  title: string
  description: string
  venue: string
  image: string
  date: Date
  time: string
  tags: string[]
  attendees: number
  maxAttendees: number
  university: string  // ✅ ADDED
  contact: string
  address: string
  createdBy: string
  createdByName?: string
  createdByEmail?: string
  eventType: 'system' | 'user-generated'
  isPublic: boolean
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### 2. `app/api/events/route.ts`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for each step
- ✅ Accept both `cafe` and `venue` field names
- ✅ Proper validation for all required fields
- ✅ Better error messages with details
- ✅ Validate maxAttendees as number
- ✅ Date validation allows today's date
- ✅ Database connection logging

**Key Code:**
```typescript
// Accept both field names for backward compatibility
const venueName = eventData.cafe || eventData.venue

// Proper number validation
const maxAttendeesNum = parseInt(eventData.maxAttendees)
if (isNaN(maxAttendeesNum) || maxAttendeesNum < 1 || maxAttendeesNum > 100) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: '...' }, { status: 400 })
}
```

### 3. `components/sections/create-event-view.tsx`
**No changes needed** - Component was already correctly sending data

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you're logged in to the application
2. Navigate to `/events` page
3. Click on "Create Event" tab

### Test Case 1: Create Basic Event
```
Title: "Test Coffee Meetup"
Description: "Testing the event creation system"
Date: Tomorrow's date
Time: "14:00"
Venue: "Central Perk"
Address: "123 Main St, Vilnius"
University: "Vilnius University"
Max Attendees: 10
Contact: "test@example.com"
Tags: Select "Social"
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Success toast notification
- ✅ Redirect to dashboard or success screen
- ✅ Event appears in events list
- ✅ Event can be booked by other users

### Test Case 2: Validation Errors
Try submitting with missing fields:
- ❌ Should show error: "Please fill in all required fields..."
- ❌ maxAttendees = 0 → Error: "Maximum attendees must be between 1 and 100"
- ❌ maxAttendees = 150 → Same error
- ❌ Past date → Error: "Event date must be today or in the future"

### Test Case 3: Check Server Logs
Open browser console and server terminal. You should see:

**Server logs:**
```
🔵 POST /api/events - Event creation request received
✅ User authenticated: user@example.com
📝 Creating event with data: {...}
🔌 Connecting to database...
✅ Database connected
✅ Event object created: {...}
💾 Inserting event into database...
✅ Event inserted with ID: 67...
✅ User event tracking created
✅ User event profile updated
```

**Browser console (if error):**
```
Error creating event: {...}
```

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### If "Failed to fetch" error occurs:

1. **Check Browser Console (F12)**
   - Look for network errors
   - Check if request is reaching `/api/events`
   - Check request payload

2. **Check Server Terminal**
   - Look for the `🔵 POST /api/events` log
   - If you don't see it, the request isn't reaching the server
   - Check for CORS issues or network problems

3. **Check Authentication**
   - Verify you see: `✅ User authenticated: user@example.com`
   - If you see: `❌ Unauthorized: No session found`
     - You need to log in again
     - Check NextAuth session configuration

4. **Check Database Connection**
   - Verify you see: `✅ Database connected`
   - If you see database errors:
     - Check MongoDB Atlas connection string
     - Check `.env.local` file exists
     - Check MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist

5. **Check Field Validation**
   - Look for: `❌ Missing fields: [...]`
   - Look for: `❌ Invalid venue name`
   - Look for: `❌ Invalid maxAttendees`
   - Look for: `❌ Event date in past`

### Common Error Messages & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Failed to fetch" | Network/CORS issue | Check dev server is running on port 3000 |
| "Unauthorized" | Not logged in | Log in via `/login` |
| "Missing required fields" | Form validation failed | Fill all required fields |
| "Venue/cafe name is required" | Venue field empty | Enter venue name |
| "Maximum attendees must be..." | Invalid number | Enter number between 1-100 |
| "Event date must be..." | Date in past | Choose today or future date |
| "Failed to connect to MongoDB" | DB connection issue | Check `.env.local` and MongoDB Atlas |

## 🚨 Known Limitations

1. **Image Upload**: Uses base64 encoding - large images may cause issues
   - **Recommendation**: Add file size validation
   - **Future**: Use cloud storage (Cloudinary, AWS S3)

2. **No Event Editing**: Once created, events can't be edited
   - **Future**: Add PUT endpoint for event updates

3. **No Event Deletion**: Can't delete events after creation
   - **Future**: Add DELETE endpoint with permissions check

4. **No Draft Saving**: Form data lost if user navigates away
   - **Future**: Add localStorage draft saving

## 📊 API Response Examples

### Successful Event Creation
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "eventId": "67890abcdef12345",
  "message": "Event created successfully!"
}
```

### Validation Error
```json
{
  "error": "Missing required fields: title, description, date"
}
```

### Server Error
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to create event",
  "details": "Connection to database failed"
}
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with the test cases above
2. **Check server logs** for any errors
3. **Verify events appear** in the events list
4. **Test booking flow** on created events
5. **Check database** - events should be in `events` collection

---

## 💡 Tips

- Always check both **browser console** and **server terminal** for errors
- Use **Incognito mode** if session issues persist
- **Clear browser cache** if you see old data
- **Restart dev server** if changes don't apply
- **Check MongoDB Compass** to verify data is being saved
