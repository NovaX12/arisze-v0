## üìã Tasks Summary

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Fix Dashboard Profile Save Issue
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Problem:** Profile changes (year, major) were being saved but would revert after application restart.

**Root Cause:** The API route `/app/api/users/profile/route.ts` only accepted fields: `name`, `bio`, `location`, `university`, `avatar`. However, the profile component was also sending `year` and `major` fields which were being silently ignored.

**Solution:**
- Added `year` and `major` to accepted fields in PUT handler
- Added comprehensive logging to track profile updates
- Fixed TypeScript error for userData access
- Profile now persists correctly after restart

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/users/profile/route.ts`

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Add Celestial Background to All Pages
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Problem:** The beautiful particle/celestial animation was only visible on the home page.

**Root Cause:** The `ParticleBackground` component was only rendered in `hero-section.tsx`.

**Solution:**
- Added `ParticleBackground` to `app/layout.tsx` wrapped in a fixed position container with z-index 0
- Wrapped all page content in a relative z-10 container to keep it above the background
- Removed duplicate `ParticleBackground` imports from:
  - `components/sections/hero-section.tsx`
  - `app/ai-hub/page.tsx`
- Background now appears on every page while keeping content interactive

**Files Modified:**
- `app/layout.tsx` (added ParticleBackground with proper z-index)
- `components/sections/hero-section.tsx` (removed duplicate)
- `app/ai-hub/page.tsx` (removed duplicate)

---

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Fix AI Hub Navigation Issue
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Problem:** When opening the AI Hub page, there was no way to navigate back or switch to other pages without using browser back button.

**Root Cause:** The AI Hub page was missing the `Header` component that provides navigation.

**Solution:**
- Imported and added `Header` component to `app/ai-hub/page.tsx`
- Header now provides consistent navigation across all pages
- Users can easily navigate between Home, Events, AI Hub, Dashboard, and Contact

**Files Modified:**
- `app/ai-hub/page.tsx`

### ‚úÖ Task 4: Scan and Fix Minor Bugs
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Problem:** Multiple accessibility warnings, TypeScript errors, and missing Next.js Image optimization props.

**Issues Fixed:**

#### 1. Dialog Accessibility Warnings
- **Issue:** Dialog components without `DialogTitle` cause accessibility errors
- **Solution:** Added `VisuallyHidden` wrapper with `DialogTitle` to:
  - `components/ui/booking-modal.tsx` ("Book Event: {event.title}")
  - `components/ui/create-event-modal.tsx` ("Create New Event")

#### 2. Next.js Image Optimization Warnings
- **Issue:** Images with `fill` prop must have `sizes` prop for optimization
- **Solution:** Added appropriate `sizes` prop to all Image components:
  - `components/sections/vibe-quiz.tsx` - `(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw`
  - `components/ui/booking-modal.tsx` - `(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 80vw, 1200px`
  - `components/ui/cafe-card.tsx` - `(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw`
  - `components/ui/event-card.tsx` - `(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw`
  - `components/ui/recommendation-card.tsx` - `(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw`

#### 3. TypeScript Errors
- **Issue:** Property 'email' does not exist on type '{ id: string; }'
- **File:** `app/api/users/profile/route.ts`
- **Solution:** Properly typed the userData extraction before accessing properties

**Files Modified:**
- `components/ui/booking-modal.tsx`
- `components/ui/create-event-modal.tsx`
- `components/sections/vibe-quiz.tsx`
- `components/ui/cafe-card.tsx`
- `components/ui/event-card.tsx`
- `components/ui/recommendation-card.tsx`
- `app/api/users/profile/route.ts`

**Result:** 
- 0 TypeScript errors
- 0 accessibility warnings
- Proper image optimization

### ‚úÖ Task 5: Update and Fix Debug Panel
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Problem:** Debug panel needed more comprehensive monitoring and verbose logging control.

**Enhancements Added:**

#### 1. Firestore Connection Status
- Added dedicated Firestore connection check
- Tests actual Firestore operations by fetching events
- Displays number of events found
- Separate status indicator from general database status

#### 2. Verbose Logging Toggle
- Added new button to toggle between verbose and simple logging
- Simple mode: Shows only messages, no details
- Verbose mode: Shows full details objects for debugging
- State preserved during session

#### 3. Improved Status Grid
- Expanded from 3 to 4 status indicators:
  1. Database (general connection)
  2. Firestore (Firebase-specific)
  3. Session (authentication)
  4. API (health check)

#### 4. Button Layout Optimization
- Changed from 2-column to 3-column layout for main actions
- Added "Verbose/Simple" toggle as third button
- Maintained all existing test buttons

**Files Modified:**
- `components/ui/debug-panel.tsx`

**New Features:**
```typescript
// State additions
const [firestoreStatus, setFirestoreStatus] = useState<'unknown' | 'connected' | 'disconnected'>('unknown')
const [verboseLogging, setVerboseLogging] = useState(false)

// New function
const checkFirestore = async () => {
  // Tests real Firestore operations
  // Displays event count
  // Updates status indicator
}
```
